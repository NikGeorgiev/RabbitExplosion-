# Rabbit Population Explosion
We are going to build a rabbit population programme.
Considerations:
Phase 1 - Rabbits
* Each second will represent a month
* Breeding rabbits reach maturity at 3 months
* The programme will start with a single breeding pair
* If a male is available a female can be pregant and give birth in one month
* Each breeding pair can create between 1-14 offspring that can be a random male or female
* A female that has given birth can breed again immediately after giving birth
* Rabbits day at 5 years
Phase 2 - Reporting
* We need to capture and manage the data of the rabbit population
* We need to report on
1. Time passed
2. Number of Rabbits in the population
3. The number of male and female rabbits at the end of the time cycle
* We also need to run the programme based on a defined time period
Phase 3 - Predators
* We will now introduce predators to affect the rabbit population
* A single Fox breeding pair will be introduced
* A fox will breed once a year
* They have between 1-10 kits 
* They reach breeding maturity in 10 months
* While food is available a single fox can eat up to 20 rabbits a month
